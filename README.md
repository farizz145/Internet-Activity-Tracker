# Internet-Activity-Tracker
Developed during the Hackathon 2019 (aka HackED 2019), this chrome plugin allows parents to keep track of their child's internet activity by keeping a log of the websites their child visited and how many hours they spent on it. It also comes with password protection so, only parents with the correct password could login and see/modify the app settings.
